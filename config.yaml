    # AWS credentials can be provided with described below methods (checked in sequence):

    # Environment variables:
    # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
    # If you're working with temporary security credentials,
    # you can also keep the session token in AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.

    # Credentials File:
    # Instead of keeping credentials in environment variables,
    # you can put credentials into a single file that's located in: ~/.aws/credentials
    # An important point is that the default location for the credentials file is a user directory.
