    # Force S3 URI style to path
    #
    # AWS S3 supports two diffrent URI styles:
    # - virtual-hosted (https://bucket-name.s3.Region.amazonaws.com/key)
    # - path-style (https://s3.Region.amazonaws.com/bucket-name/key)
    #
    # Buckets created after September 30, 2020, will support only virtual
    # hosted-style requests. Path-style requests will continue to be supported
    # for buckets created on or before this date.
    #
    # For more information, see Amazon S3 Path Deprecation Plan:
    # https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-s3-path-deprecation-plan-the-rest-of-the-story/

    #
    # Authentication credentials for AWS.
    # AWS role requires READ/WRITE permissions for configured S3 bucket.
    #
    # AWS credentials can be provided with described below methods (checked in sequence):
    #
    # Environment variables:
    # AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID and AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY.
    # If you're working with temporary security credentials,
    # you can also keep the session token in AWS_SESSION_TOKEN.
    #
    # If you're testing with a fake s3 environment, you can specify the uri endpoint with: DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_URI
    #
    # Credentials File:
    # Instead of keeping credentials in environment variables,
    # you can put credentials into a single file that's located in: ~/.aws/credentials
    # An important point is that the default location for the credentials file is a user directory.
    #
    # The format for the credentials is the same for all the SDKs and the AWS CLI:
    #
    #     [default]
    #     aws_access_key_id = ACCESS_KEY
    #     aws_secret_access_key = SECRET_KEY
    #     aws_session_token = TOKEN
    #
    # The aws_session_token value is needed only if you're including temporary security credentials in the file.
    #
    # Alternatively they can be provided directly using "auth" section.
    #
    # Token is optional, it is needed if working with temporaty credentials.
    #
    # In case when none of the credential retrieving methods are set, service will default to retrieving authentication
    # credentials locally from AWS IAM which is prefered method then running the service in EC2
    #
    # Overwrite with environment variables:
    # - DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_KEY
    # - DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_SECRET
    # - DEPLOYMENTS_AWS_AUTH_TOKEN

  # Presign secret
  # The secret used for signing URLs. For HMAC256 the value must be a valid

  # Presign hostname
  # This is the hostname (to the gateway proxy) used for generating

  # Overwrite with environment variable: DEPLOYMENTS_PRESIGN_URL_HOSTNAME
  url_hostname: ""
  # Presign URL scheme
