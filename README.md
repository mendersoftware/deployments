Mender: Deployment Service
==============================================

Mender is an open source over-the-air (OTA) software updater for embedded Linux
devices. Mender comprises a client running at the embedded device, as well as
a server that manages deployments across many devices.

This repository contains the Mender Deployments service, which is part of the
Mender server. The Mender server is designed as a microservices architecture
and comprises several repositories.

The Deployment Service manages artifacts, deployments, and reports of outcome of deployments.

## Getting started

To start using Mender, we recommend that you begin with the Getting started
section in [the Mender documentation](https://docs.mender.io/).


## Building from source

As the Mender server is designed as microservices architecture, it requires several
repositories to be built to be fully functional. If you are testing the Mender server it
is therefore easier to follow the getting started section above as it integrates these
services.

If you would like to build the Deployments Service independently, you can follow
these steps:

```
git clone https://github.com/mendersoftware/deployments.git
cd deployments
go build
```

## Configuration

The service can be configured by:
* providing configuration file (supports JSON, TOML, YAML and HCL formatting).
The default configuration file is provided to be downloaded from [config.yaml](https://github.com/mendersoftware/deployments/blob/master/config.yaml).
* setting environment variables. The service will check for a environment variable
with a name matching the key uppercased and prefixed with DEPLOYMENTS_.
Eg. for "listen" the variable name is "DEPLOYMENTS_LISTEN".

Application requirements:
* Access to AWS S3 bucket, keys can be configured in several ways, documented in the configuration file.
* Access to MongoDB instance and configured in config file. [Installation instructions](https://www.mongodb.org/downloads#)
* Access to Mender Gateway with Integration API access.
